              The image represents cross-sections of yeast that have bioaccumulated heavy metals on their surface, as well as internally.
            popup: >
              My first publication centered on using yeast to metabolically react with heavy metals, specifically those found in oil spills such as Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), Mercury (Hg), etc. The inspiration came from what occurs naturally, biomineralization &mdash; much like our bones &mdash; but instead steer it towards heavy metal remediation.

              To deploy in the real world, these engineered yeast can be packed much like traditional chromatography filters to sequester contaminates as they pass, as shown by the chance in color.
